        <h2 class="what-is-join">What is Join?</h2>
        <p>Join is a powerful Kanban project management tool that helps teams efficiently organize and manage their
            projects. With a user-friendly interface and a variety of features, Join provides an intuitive platform for
            collaboration and task progress.</p>
        <h2 class="how-to-use">How to use it</h2>

        <div class="ol">
            <ol>
                <li><span>1.</span><p>Create Kanban boards: Join allows users to create customizable Kanban boards to visualize their
                    projects. Teams can divide their work into columns representing different stages or categories, such
                    as
                    "To Do," "In Progress," and "Completed." This provides a clear overview of the project and helps
                    team
                    members understand the workflow.</p></li>
                <li><span>2.</span><p>Capture tasks: Within each Kanban board, team members can capture tasks by creating cards. These
                    cards
                    represent individual tasks or work items. Users can add descriptions, attachments, due dates, and
                    assignees to provide comprehensive information about each task. By capturing tasks in Join, teams
                    have a
                    centralized location to track and manage their work.</p></li>
                <li><span>3.</span><p>Delegate tasks: Join simplifies task delegation and collaboration. Team members can assign tasks to
                    specific individuals, ensuring clarity and accountability. By assigning tasks, it becomes clear who
                    is
                    responsible for completing each task, reducing confusion and enabling efficient teamwork.
                    Additionally,
                    Join allows users to set deadlines and reminders, ensuring that everyone stays on track and meets
                    project milestones.</p></li>
